## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
  
### Prerequisites

You either need your own tile server such as the one provided by [openmaptiles.org](https://openmaptiles.org) or a Mapbox API access token ( they have a free Starter plan! ), so [sign up with Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/).
Once you've registered go to your Account > Apps > New token. The 'Default Secret Token' is what you'll need.

You will also need to set up your development environment. To import the access token you created into the project, open the [environment.ts](./src/environments/environment.ts) file and type the access token:

```typescript
//.src/environment/environment.ts

export const environment = {
  mapbox: {
    accessToken: 'YOUR-MAPBOX-ACCESS-TOKEN',
  }
};
```
After importing your own token into the development environment, to run this project in production or development mode you have to make sure, `ionic` and `cordova` are installed globally on your computer. 

Before proceeding, also check if [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (bundled with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) is installed. It is recommended to select the LTS version to ensure best compatibility.

- To check if it is installed:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
- Install ionic and cordova command line interface globally:
 ```bash
npm install -g ionic cordova
```
### Installation

To get this project, clone the repository directly using git or download a zip copy from the [master branch on Github](https://github.com/enessfk/IonMaps/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enessfk/IonMaps.git IonMaps
```

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the app in your browser:

```bash
